  This is a basic kubernetes charm for testing.

  It has an action (basic-action) taking a data parameter.
  It has a container (basic-container) running a simple demo app.

  It's good to have a charm like this for integration testing.

  This may be useful for testing other changes in ops and ops-testing.
